# Financial API Project

## Project Overview

The Financial API Project is a Django-based web application designed to manage and analyse financial transactions. It provides six endpoints for monitoring suspicious activity, tracking spending patterns, and generating merchant-specific reports.

The API includes the following main endpoints:

1. Transaction History - Retrieves detailed transaction records for specific accounts
2. Suspicious Activity Monitoring - Flags and monitors potentially suspicious transactions
3. Merchant Transaction Summary - Provides transaction analysis grouped by merchants
4. Transaction Management - Handles creation of new transaction records
5. Spending Analytics - Generates insights and patterns from transaction data
6. High-Frequency Account Detection - Identifies accounts with high frequency transaction

The project serves as a comprehensive financial transaction analysis system, offering both monitoring and analytical capabilities through its RESTful API interface, built with Django REST Framework and fully documented using Swagger.
